# Breast Cancer Classification Project

This repository contains a machine learning project for breast cancer classification. The goal of this project is to develop and compare different machine learning models to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which is available in the scikit-learn library. It consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0)

## Project Structure

- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Includes code for loading the dataset, preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes the distribution of target classes, explores relationships between features and the target variable, and identifies correlations between features.
- **Feature Selection**: Uses feature selection techniques like SelectKBest to select relevant features.
- **Model Building**: Builds and evaluates various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares the performance of different models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the results of model evaluation using charts and plots.
- **Predictive System**: Implements a predictive system to make predictions on new data using the best-performing model.

## Getting Started

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your machine
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts in the appropriate order to execute the project steps.

## Results

The project results indicate that [mention the best-performing model] achieves the highest accuracy [mention the accuracy score]. Detailed performance metrics for each model are provided in the project documentation.
